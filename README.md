## Punting around the European Soccer Database from Kaggle

Previously, a competition was posted on Kaggle to predict the outcome of a game given a dataset concerning soccer matches and players.
As a casual soccer fan, I decided to download the sqlite dataset, put it on a MS SQL Server in AWS, and play around with the data. 
In the future I plan on sharing some analysis with the data using R or Python, but for now, here is a gander at some of my SQL coding.
